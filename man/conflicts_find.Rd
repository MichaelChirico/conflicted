}
\arguments{
\item{pkgs}{Set of packages for which to report conflicts. If \code{NULL},
the default, will report conflicts for all loaded packages}
}
\value{
A named list of character vectors. The names are functions and
the values are the packages where they appear. If there is only a single
package listed, it means that an automated disambiguation has selected
that function.

}
\description{
\code{conflicts_find()} is the workhorse behind the conflicted package. You can
call it directly yourself if you want to see all conflicts before hitting
them in practice.
